            "I started felting using merino wool in 2010 during my recovery from thyroid cancer. I fell in love with the magical transformation that happens during the felting process when the fibers begin to connect.",
            "When I work with fiber Iâ€™m revitalizing the art of creating with my hands, and my soul connects with the past. The piece of fabric I create is a piece of art born of a conscious mind. LUJO make it possible for me to expand my art by donating fiber for me to incorporate into my work.",
            "My fabrics are all natural and do not use chemicals, so you can bury it in the ground and it dissolves without harming the environment.",
            "Each pair of LUJO boots is custom designed to suit your personal style. We pair one of a kind fabric with exotic skins and hand craft each pair of boots.",
            "Prices range from $3,500 to $5,000."],
